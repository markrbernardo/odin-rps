# Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Preview of this Project is found here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/markrbernardo/odin-rps/blob/main/index.html
* This Project uses Audio from http://www.Zapsplat.com
- Objective: make a simple implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" run on the console.
- Future Objective: Add a GUI with buttons and text

- With this project I hope to:
    - Practice more logic through the use of javascript
    - Practice a bit of design when GUI is added
    - Maybe even theme the design as a card game?

## Log
### 03.24.2023 Project Start Date
### 03.27.2023
- Finished console-based rps game on javascript.js
- Beginning to create the GUI of game

### 03.28.2023
- Continued to make wireframe of GUI
    - Worked out how to simplify classes a bit more. Still uncertain of best practices.
    - Really focusing on responsiveness
    - Used a CSS media query for the first time

### 04.03.2023
- Gutted the old html and started fresh to make the interface better and more responsive.
- Tried to keep tabs on classes to make sense.

### 04.05.2023
- Began to tinker with javascript to make the html and css more interactive
- Created an OnOff sequence utilizing setTimeout() to delay code
- Need to getPlayerChoice via button clicks

### 04.07.2023
- Fixed button issue where the id value of the .player-card button was not registering 
- Added some fun sounds to OnOff sequence
- Previewed project on mobile device
    - The overall look is not great, need to adjust responsiveness
- Next step is to figure out how to display and evaluate the 5-round system
- The game generally does what I want to do, but I need to fix the roundIndicatorSequence from running the 6th time.
- I have a lot of repeating code that I can clean up.
