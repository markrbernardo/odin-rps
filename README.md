# Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
Objective: make a simple implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" run on the console.
Future Objective: Add a GUI with buttons and text

- With this project I hope to:
    - Practice more logic through the use of javascript
    - Practice a bit of design when GUI is added
    - Maybe even theme the design as a card game?
